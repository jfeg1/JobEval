### Evaluating Multiple Positions

JobEval supports evaluating multiple positions for the same company:

1. **Complete your first evaluation** - Follow the In-Depth Analysis flow completely
2. **Click "Evaluate Another Position"** - This keeps your company profile but clears position data
3. **Update payroll tracking (recommended):**
   - Go to Settings → Company Profile
   - Update "Current Payroll" to reflect the newly committed salary
   - This helps track cumulative payroll impact across multiple hires
4. **Continue with next position** - Repeat the process for each role

**Note:** In v0.9, payroll tracking is manual. v1.0 will include automatic position history and cumulative budget tracking.
