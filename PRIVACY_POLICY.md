# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 13, 2025

## Overview

JobEval is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our open-source salary evaluation tool.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO personal data.** JobEval is designed as a completely privacy-first application:

- ❌ No user accounts required
- ❌ No tracking cookies
- ❌ No analytics scripts
- ❌ No server-side data storage
- ❌ No third-party integrations
- ❌ No form submissions to external servers

## Local Data Storage

All data you create in JobEval is stored **exclusively on your device** using your browser's IndexedDB:

- Company profile information
- Position definitions
- Evaluation results
- User preferences

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Cannot be accessed by us or anyone else
- Remains under your complete control

## Your Rights & Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export:** Download all your data anytime via Settings → Export Data
- **Delete:** Remove all stored data anytime via Settings → Clear All Data
- **Backup:** Use the Export function to create backups
- **Portability:** Exported data is in JSON format for easy portability

## Third-Party Services

JobEval uses public data sources but does not send your information to them:

- **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):** Wage data is embedded in the application
- **O*NET:** Occupation data is embedded in the application

These datasets are downloaded once during development and packaged with the application. No real-time connections are made when you use JobEval.

## Open Source

JobEval is open source software (AGPL-3.0). You can:
- Review the complete source code on GitHub
- Verify our privacy claims yourself
- Host your own instance if desired
- Contribute to the project

## Browser Permissions

JobEval only requests permissions necessary for basic functionality:
- **Local Storage:** To save your data locally (IndexedDB)
- No other permissions are requested or required

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy:
- Updates will be posted on GitHub
- Version number and "Last Updated" date will change
- Major changes will be announced in release notes

## Children's Privacy

JobEval is a business tool not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect any data at all, this is not a concern.

## International Users

JobEval works the same way globally:
- All data stays on your device regardless of location
- No data crosses international boundaries
- No country-specific data collection or storage

## Contact

## Legal Basis (GDPR Compliance)

For users in the EU/UK:
- We don't process personal data, so GDPR data processing requirements don't apply
- You maintain complete control over any data created (data controller role)
- No consent is needed because we don't collect data
- No data is transferred outside your device

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

For California residents:
- We don't sell personal information (we don't collect any)
- We don't share personal information with third parties
- You have the right to request deletion (use Settings → Clear All Data)
- You have the right to opt-out of data sales (not applicable - we don't sell data)

## Security

Your data is as secure as your device:
- Data is stored in your browser's encrypted IndexedDB
- Access requires physical access to your device
- Standard browser security protections apply
- We recommend:
  - Using a secure device password/PIN
  - Regularly backing up exported data
  - Clearing data if sharing a device

## Disclaimer

JobEval is provided "as is" for salary evaluation purposes. Any decisions made using JobEval are your sole responsibility. We recommend:
- Consulting legal and financial professionals
- Verifying market data independently
- Understanding local labor laws and regulations
- Backing up your data regularly

**Bottom Line:** Your data never leaves your device. Period.
